# üß≠ Personalized Travel Planning Assistant

## üìå Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered travel assistant that generates personalized multi-day itineraries based on a user‚Äôs selected destination and interests (e.g., hiking, food, fishing, history). It integrates structured and unstructured data from APIs and public content sources, and includes a graphical interface using KivyMD and MapView for enhanced user interaction.

---

## üîç How It Works

1. **User Input:** The user provides a destination and selects interests.
2. **Data Aggregation:**
   - **Reddit posts** are parsed using `praw` and loaded as searchable documents.
   - **Wikipedia, NPS API, and Rec.gov** provide factual summaries and outdoor activity listings.
   - **OpenRouteService** provides directions and travel time between locations.
   - **Hotel data** is provided via static placeholder entries in `hotel_info.py`.
3. **Itinerary Generation:**
   - LangChain pipelines build an itinerary based on interest matching.
   - LangGraph organizes the logic for input parsing ‚Üí data matching ‚Üí formatting.
4. **Output:** A structured, readable itinerary with 4‚Äì5 full days of activity planning.

## üìà Evaluation

Although this is not a predictive model, we evaluated our results by:
- Manually reviewing output itineraries to verify interest alignment.
- Checking for logistical feasibility (e.g., daily travel distances).
- Testing modular components independently (e.g., NPS API, route logic).
- Confirming app components rendered correctly in the Kivy GUI.
- Validating that output matched user intent across multiple test scenarios.

---

## üöÄ Future Development

- Add live scraping and sentiment filtering for Reddit.
- Expand and polish the KivyMD-based GUI; add touch interaction and completed MapView integration.
- Integrate real-time flight and lodging APIs like Amadeus or Booking.com.
- Enable itinerary saving, sharing, and export options (PDF, email, calendar).

## üß∞ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo  
2. Set up your environment variables (`.env`) for API keys  
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app:

```bash
python main.py
```

5. (Optional) Build the Android app:

```bash
buildozer android debug
```
